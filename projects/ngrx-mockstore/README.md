# NgRx-MockStore

The MockStore library from @ngrx/store/testing, made available in a standalone package to accommodate testing @ngrx/store v5 and v6.

## Installation

This library should be installed as a `devDependencies` separately from `@ngrx/store`:

`npm install --save-dev ngrx-mockstore`

## Usage

See usage of `provideMockStore` and `MockStore` in the [NgRx store testing documentation](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/testing).  However, instead of importing from `@ngrx/store/testing`, import from `ngrx-mockstore`.
